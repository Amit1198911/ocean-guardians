            <p>The ocean is a vast and mysterious world that covers over 70% of the Earth's surface. It is home to a diverse range of
            life forms, from the tiniest plankton to the largest whales. Understanding and preserving this incredible biodiversity
            is crucial for the health of our planet.However, this delicate beauty is under threat due to various human activities that are causing unprecedented levels of
            pollution</p>

            <h2>Impact Of Pollution on Marine Life</h2>
            <li>Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the ocean each year, harming marine animals that ingest or become entangled
            in plastic debris.</li>
            <li>Industrial runoff, agricultural chemicals, and oil spills introduce toxic substances into marine environments, poisoning
            marine life and disrupting ecosystems.</li>

            marine life and disrupting ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification, caused by increased carbon dioxide levels, are bleaching coral reefs
            and altering the habitats of many marine species.</li>

                <h3>Ocean Health is Critical for Human Survival</h3>
                <p>Oceans produce at least 50% of the planet's oxygen, which is essential for human life. They also absorb about 30% of the
                carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffering the impacts of global warming</p>

            <div class="text-content">
                <h3>Coral Reefs are Vital and Vulnerable</h3>
                <p>Coral reefs support a vast number of marine species and provide critical ecosystem services, such as coastal protection
                and tourism revenue. They are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and acidity, making them particularly
                vulnerable to climate change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text-content">
                <h3>Plastic Pollution is a Major Threat</h3>
                <p>Approximately 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, causing harm to marine life and ecosystems. This
                pollution can result in the ingestion and entanglement of marine animals, and microplastics can enter the human food
                chain through seafood.</p>

            <div class="text-content">
                <h3>Deep Sea Universe</h3>
                <p>More than 80% of the ocean remains unexplored. The deep sea holds potential for new scientific discoveries, including
                new species and medical compounds, but it is also vulnerable to human exploitation and pollution.
